Additional consequences: payee may charge late fee, may be reported as late payment, could affect credit score for credit accounts, may result in service termination for utilities/subscriptions. Overdraft vs NSF: overdraft means we cover payment (you go negative, charged overdraft fee), NSF means we don't cover (returned to payee, charged NSF fee). Fee waivers: first occurrence often waived with request, good account history may waive 1-2 per year, financial hardship may qualify for fee assistance program. Prevention: low balance alerts, overdraft protection (link savings account), account buffer ($100-500 minimum), track spending with budgeting app. Request refund: call 1-800-555-BANK within 30 days to request fee review.",
