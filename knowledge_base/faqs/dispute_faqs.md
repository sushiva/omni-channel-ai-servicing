### Q: What's the difference between a dispute and fraud?
**A:** **Important distinction for processing:**

**Fraud/Unauthorized Transaction:**
- ❌ You did NOT authorize the charge
- ❌ You don't recognize merchant
- ❌ Someone else used your card without permission
- **Report to**: Fraud hotline 1-800-555-FRAUD (37283)
- **Action**: Immediate card cancellation, fraud investigation
- **Liability**: $0-$50 max (often $0)

**Dispute/Chargeback:**
- ✅ You authorized the transaction
- ✅ BUT: Didn't receive goods/services, received wrong/defective item, charged wrong amount, charged after cancellation
- **Report to**: Standard dispute process
- **Action**: Investigation with merchant
- **Liability**: Depends on outcome

**Grey Area - Report as Fraud:**
- Subscription you cancelled but still charging
- Test charges that weren't supposed to post
- Duplicate charges from technical errors

---

### Q: What if the merchant refuses to issue a refund?
**A:** **This is what chargebacks are for:**

**Process:**
1. **Try Merchant First**: Contact merchant for refund (required first step)
2. **Document Attempts**: Save emails, call logs, screenshots
3. **File Dispute**: If merchant unresponsive or refuses
4. **We Contact Merchant**: Bank disputes charge on your behalf
5. **Merchant Responds**: Has 30 days to provide evidence
6. **Investigation**: Review both sides
7. **Decision**: Final ruling within 60-90 days

**Merchant Won't Respond?** You automatically win after 30-day window.

**Merchant Provides Evidence?** We review and make final determination based on:
- Card network rules (Visa/Mastercard regulations)
- Transaction documentation
- Your supporting evidence
- Merchant's terms and conditions

## Common Dispute Scenarios

### Q: I was charged twice for the same purchase. How do I get a refund?
**A:** **Duplicate charges are fast to resolve:**

**Fastest Path:**
1. Check if one is a temporary authorization (pending) - it will drop off
2. Contact merchant first - many refund duplicate immediately
3. If both charges posted and merchant won't help, file dispute

**When You File:**
- Select reason: "Duplicate Charge"
- Provide: Original transaction date, amount, confirmation number
- Evidence: Receipt showing single purchase

**Resolution Time**: 15-30 days (faster than most disputes)

**Provisional Credit**: Usually within 5 business days for obvious duplicates.

---

### Q: I never received the item I ordered online. Can I dispute the charge?
**A:** **Yes, this is a common chargeback reason:**

**Before Disputing - Required Steps:**
1. Check tracking: Item may still be in transit
2. Contact merchant: Request refund or reshipping
3. Wait reasonable timeframe: Merchant's stated delivery window + 5 days
4. Document everything: Tracking, emails, order confirmation

**When to Dispute:**
- Tracking shows "delivered" but you never received it
- Delivery window passed with no shipment
- Merchant unresponsive to refund requests

**Evidence Needed:**
- Order confirmation
- Tracking number (if provided)
- Communication with merchant
- Proof of delivery address

**Success Rate**: Very high if tracking shows non-delivery or merchant is unresponsive.

---

### Q: The item I received is defective or not as described. Can I get a refund?
**A:** **Yes, but merchant contact required first:**

**Process:**
1. **Contact Merchant First**: Request return/refund per their policy
2. **Return Item If Possible**: Follow merchant's return process
3. **Keep Evidence**:
   - Photos of defective/incorrect item
   - Product description from website
   - Order confirmation
   - Return tracking (if you sent it back)

**Dispute Grounds:**
- "Merchandise Not as Described"
- "Defective Merchandise"
- Include: Description mismatch details, photos, merchant communication

**Common Issues:**
- Clothing wrong size: Must prove description was inaccurate
- Electronics don't work: Must show defect, not user error
- Counterfeit items: Strong case for chargeback

**Timeline**: Allow 30 days for merchant to respond to return before filing dispute.

---

### Q: I cancelled a subscription, but they're still charging me. What do I do?
**A:** **This is a chargeable dispute:**

**Immediate Steps:**
1. **Contact Merchant**: Request cancellation confirmation in writing
2. **Check Cancellation Policy**: Ensure you followed correct procedure
3. **Document Cancellation**: Save confirmation emails, screenshots

**If Charges Continue:**
- File dispute: "Services Cancelled"
- Evidence: Cancellation confirmation, screenshots, email timestamps
- Specify: Date cancelled, number of charges since cancellation

**Recurring Charge Protection:**
- We can block future charges from this merchant
- Set up alerts for subscription charges
- Review subscriptions monthly in app

**Success Rate**: Very high if you can prove cancellation.

### Q: A hotel or rental car company charged me more than the authorization. Can I dispute the extra amount?
**A:** **Depends on the circumstances:**

**Normal Situations (Not Disputable):**
- Incidentals, minibar, or room service added to bill
- Fuel charges for rental car (if you didn't refill tank)
- Damage charges with documentation
- Toll charges

**Disputable Situations:**
- Charged for damages you didn't cause (without proof)
- Charged significantly more than authorization with no explanation
- Hidden fees not disclosed at booking
- Charged after returning item in agreed-upon condition

**How to Dispute:**
- Evidence needed: Rental agreement, photos of returned vehicle/room, pre-authorization amount
- Explain: What the original charge should have been vs. actual charge
- Include: Any damage waiver or insurance documentation

**Pro Tip**: Always take photos/videos when returning rental cars or checking out of hotels—timestamp them.

## Authorization and Pending Charges

### Q: There's a pending charge I want to dispute. Can I dispute it now?
**A:** **Wait for the charge to post (with one exception):**

**Why Wait:**
- Pending charges are authorizations, not final
- May drop off on their own (especially hotel/rental pre-auths)
- Final amount may differ from pending amount
- Can't formally dispute until posted

**Exception - Clear Fraud:**
- If pending charge is obviously fraud, report immediately
- We can cancel card to prevent charge from posting
- Fraud hotline: 1-800-555-FRAUD (37283)

**Timeline:**
- Most pending charges post within 2-3 business days
- Hotel/gas station pre-auths can take 5-7 days to drop
- If pending for 7+ days, contact merchant first

**Track It**: Set up alerts for when pending charges post, then dispute immediately if unauthorized.

---

### Q: What's the difference between a pending charge and a posted charge?
**A:** **Understanding transaction states:**

**Pending Charge:**
- Merchant requested authorization
- Bank placed hold on funds
- Not yet finalized
- Amount may change
- Can't be formally disputed yet
- May drop off without posting

**Posted Charge:**
- Transaction finalized and settled
- Final amount deducted
- Appears on statement
- Can be disputed
- Won't drop off without action

**Common Scenario:**
- Gas station: Pending $100 authorization → Posts as $45 actual purchase
- Hotel: Pending $500 pre-auth → Posts as $287 actual stay

**How Long:** Pending charges usually post within 2-3 business days, or drop off within 7 days.

- **$50 maximum liability**: If reported after card used but before statement
- **No liability**: For online/phone transactions (card-not-present)

**Debit Card (Regulation E / Electronic Fund Transfer Act):**
- **$0 liability**: If reported within 2 business days
- **$50 maximum**: If reported within 60 days

### Q: Can I dispute a charge if I gave someone permission to use my card?
**A:** **This is tricky—depends on circumstances:**

**Usually NOT Disputable:**
- Gave someone your card voluntarily
- Authorized them to make purchases
- They spent more than you expected
- You had a disagreement later

**Why:** You authorized the user, making it a civil matter between you and that person, not fraud.

**Exception - MAY Be Disputable:**
- Authorized for specific amount, they charged more
- Authorized for one-time use, they made recurring charges
- Authorized for specific merchant, they used elsewhere
- They used card fraudulently after you revoked permission

**Best Approach:**
1. Attempt to resolve with person who used card
2. File police report if they refuse to repay
3. Contact us—we'll review on case-by-case basis

**Prevention**: Never give your card number to anyone, use authorized users or joint accounts instead.

---

### Q: What if I lose a dispute? Can I appeal?
**A:** **Yes, you have appeal rights:**

**Appeal Process:**
1. **Review Determination Letter**: Explains why dispute was denied
2. **Gather New Evidence**: Additional documentation supporting your case
3. **File Appeal**: Within 30 days of denial
4. **Provide New Information**: What wasn't included in initial investigation
5. **Escalation**: We may escalate to card network (Visa/Mastercard) for arbitration

**Common Reasons for Denial:**
- Merchant provided proof of delivery
- Transaction matches your historical patterns
- Evidence supports merchant's position
- You didn't respond to information requests during investigation

**Arbitration (Last Resort):**
- Card network makes final binding decision
- Used for high-value disputes
- May involve fees ($500+)
- Final decision with no further appeal

**Success Rate**: Appeals succeed 20-30% of the time when new evidence is provided.

### Q: Should I contact the merchant or the bank first when I have a problem?
**A:** **Always contact merchant first (with rare exceptions):**

**Merchant First:**
- ✅ Faster resolution (often immediate refund)
- ✅ Maintains good merchant relationships

**Contact Bank First - Only If:**

- ❌ Merchant out of business
- ❌ Merchant unresponsive for 15+ days
- ❌ Merchant refuses refund unreasonably
- ❌ Time-sensitive (approaching dispute deadline)

**Best Practice:**
1. Contact merchant (save communication)
2. Allow 7-10 days for resolution
3. If unresolved, file dispute
4. Include merchant communication as evidence

**Exception**: Fraud always goes directly to fraud hotline, not merchant.
