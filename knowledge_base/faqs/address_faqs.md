# Address Update Frequently Asked Questions

## Quick Questions

### Q: How long does an address update take to process?
**A:** Processing time depends on your submission method:
- **Online/Mobile App**: 1-2 business days
- **Phone**: 3-5 business days  
- **In-Branch**: Immediate to 1 business day
- **Cross-State Changes**: Add 2-3 business days for enhanced security review

The updated address appears in your online banking profile immediately after approval, but system-wide propagation (statements, cards, etc.) may take 24-72 hours.

### Q: Can I use a PO Box as my address?
**A:** Yes, but with limitations:
- ✅ **Accepted**: As mailing address for statements and correspondence
- ❌ **Not Accepted**: As primary physical address on file
- ❌ **Cannot Use**: For credit/debit card delivery (requires physical address)

**Why?** Regulatory compliance (PATRIOT Act) requires a physical address verification for all customers. You can have both a physical address and PO Box on file—just specify which one for specific purposes.

### Q: What documents do I need to update my address?
**A:** Required documentation:

**Same-State Address Change:**
1. Valid government-issued photo ID (driver's license, passport, state ID)
2. One proof of new address dated within 60 days:
   - Utility bill (water, electric, gas, internet)
   - Lease agreement or mortgage statement
   - Bank statement from another institution
   - Government correspondence (DMV, IRS)

**Cross-State Address Change:**
- Everything above PLUS:
- Secondary form of ID verification
- Documentation showing both old and new addresses

**International Address:**
- Embassy or consulate documentation
- Notarized proof of residence
- International mailing address verification

---

### Q: Do I need to notify you every time I move?
**A:** **Yes, always update your address when you permanently relocate.** It's important for:
- Receiving important account notices
- Getting replacement cards
- Receiving tax documents
- Security alerts and fraud prevention
- Regulatory compliance

**For Temporary Moves**: Consider our temporary address feature (1-12 months) instead of changing your permanent address. Perfect for extended travel, seasonal residences, or temporary work assignments.

---

### Q: Will changing my address affect my credit score?
**A:** **No**, updating your address with us does not affect your credit score. However:
- We **do** report your updated address to credit bureaus
- This helps maintain accurate credit records
- Ensures future credit pulls show current address
- Helps prevent identity theft (mismatched addresses raise flags)

**Pro tip**: Update your address directly with the three credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion) as well to ensure consistency across all your financial accounts.

## Moving Scenarios

### Q: I'm moving this weekend. When should I update my address?
**A:** **Best practice: Update 3-5 days before your move.**

**Timeline:**
- **1 week before move**: Update address with bank
- **3-5 days before**: Address processes and propagates to systems
- **Moving day**: New address active for all services
- **After move**: Set up mail forwarding with USPS as backup

**Don't wait until after moving**—there could be a gap where important mail goes to your old address.

---

### Q: I'm moving out of state. Is the process different?
**A:** **Yes, cross-state moves require additional verification**:

**Extra Steps:**
1. Secondary ID verification required
2. Enhanced security review (adds 2-3 business days)
3. Callback verification to previous phone number
4. Documentation showing both old and new addresses

**Why?** Cross-state moves are higher risk for fraud, so we take extra precautions to protect your account.

**Timeline**: Allow 5-7 business days total for cross-state address changes.

**A:** **Yes, but with special requirements**:

**Requirements:**
- Embassy or consulate documentation
- Notarized proof of residence
- International postal service verification
- May require additional forms for tax purposes

**Processing Time**: 5-10 business days (longer than domestic)

## Common Issues

### Q: I updated my address online, but my statements are still going to my old address. Why?
**A:** **This is usually a timing issue**:

**Statement Timing:**
- If your statement already generated before address update, it goes to old address
- Next statement cycle will use new address
- Allow one full statement cycle after approval

**System Propagation:**
- Address updates take 24-72 hours to reach all systems
- Statement system updates nightly
- If it's been more than one full cycle, contact us

**Solution**: Request statement delivery preferences to be updated manually if urgent.

---

### Q: My card was sent to my old address even though I updated it. What do I do?
**A:** **This happens occasionally due to timing**:

**If Card Sent to Old Address:**
1. **Call us immediately**: 1-800-555-BANK (2265)
2. **Report card as lost**: Prevents unauthorized use
3. **Verify current address**: Ensure it's correct in system
4. **Request replacement**: Sent to verified current address
5. **Expedite if needed**: $15 fee for 1-2 day delivery

**Prevention**: When updating address, specifically ask about pending card shipments—we can update those individually if needed.

---

### Q: I receive an error message when trying to update my address online. What should I do?
**A:** **Common reasons and solutions**:

**Error: "Address Cannot Be Verified"**

- Try re-entering with different formatting
- Use USPS address verification tool first
- Call us if address is definitely correct (new construction, rural addresses)

**A:** **This is a security measure to protect you from fraud**:

**Confirmation to Old Address:**
- Alerts you if change was unauthorized
- Gives you opportunity to report fraud immediately
- Required by regulations
- Mailed within 48 hours of change

**Confirmation to New Address:**

**Both confirmations include:**

**If You Didn't Authorize**: Call fraud hotline immediately, even if 48 hours has passed.

## Special Situations

### Q: I have multiple accounts. Do I need to update the address for each one separately?
**A:** **No, one address update covers all your accounts with us**:

**Single Update Updates:**
- All checking and savings accounts
- Credit cards
- Loans and mortgages
- Investment accounts
- Safe deposit box records (though physical access is location-specific)

**How It Works:**
- Master customer profile contains your address
- All accounts link to this profile
- Update propagates automatically
- Takes 24-72 hours for full system propagation

**Exception**: Business accounts are separate—must update business account addresses independently from personal accounts.

---

### Q: My spouse and I have joint accounts. If one of us updates the address, does it update for both?
**A:** **Yes, for joint accounts:**

**Joint Account Address Change:**
- Either owner can initiate change
- Updates for both owners on that account
- Notifications sent to both email addresses
- Both see same address in online banking

**Separate Individual Accounts:**
- If you each have individual accounts too, those maintain separate addresses
- Must update those individually (or both at same time)

**Best Practice**: Coordinate with co-owner before changing address on joint accounts.
