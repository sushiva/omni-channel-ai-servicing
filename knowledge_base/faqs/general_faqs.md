### Q: What's the difference between available and current balance?
**A:** **Important distinction for managing funds:**

**Current Balance:**
- Total funds in your account
- Includes deposits not yet available
- Does NOT subtract pending transactions
- What you "own" on paper

**Available Balance:**
- Funds you can actually use RIGHT NOW
- Subtracts pending transactions
- Subtracts holds on deposits
- Subtracts ATM authorizations
- What you can spend without overdrawing

**Example Scenario:**
```
Starting Balance: $1,000

Monday: 
- Current Balance: $1,000
- Available Balance: $1,000

Tuesday: Deposit $500 check (on hold)
- Current Balance: $1,500
- Available Balance: $1,000 (deposit held)

Wednesday: Gas station pre-auth $75
- Current Balance: $1,500
- Available Balance: $925 ($1,000 - $75 pending)

Thursday: Gas purchase posts at $45, check clears $200
- Current Balance: $1,255 ($1,500 - $45 - $200)
- Available Balance: $1,255 (all cleared)
```

**Always Use Available Balance** for spending decisions to avoid overdrafts.
